Making code changes
Install the Git client for your operating system, and from your command line run

git clone ssh://58dbf23489f5cf2fc7000076@jbosswildfly-pa.rhcloud.com/~/git/jbosswildfly.git/

Managing Git Branches

When you git push origin <BRANCH> . Openshift re-deploys you app (through git hooks). You HAVE TO USE 
the openshift "RHC" utility to make sure you app is re-deployed when you move to a new branch.

Example:

$local mwave dev> git checkout -b dev-1.0 
$local mwave dev>  rhc -a jbosswildfly app-configure --deployment-branch dev-1.0

Note! we had to perform 2 steps: 1) create new git branch (and switch to it). 2) reset openshift to deploy when the new
dev-1.0 branch is pushed

$local mwave dev> git commit -m "testing new dev-1.0 branch"
$local mwave dev> git push origin dev-1.0

NOTE! your command line should display not only the git push result but also the openshift redeploy steps. 


Wildfly Custom Config

The hidden dir .openshift/config/standalone.xml can be modified.

For example, I used a local wildfly admin console to define a couple of datasources. I copied the local wildfly/standalone.xml
datasource statements into the .openshift/standolone.xml. I then modified the statements to use the OPENSHIFT environment
variables for settings like connection urls, username and passwords.
